# CatchUp-Social_Platform
A Full-Stack Social Media App
This is a complete social media platform built from the ground up, featuring user authentication, post creation, comments, and claps. This project serves as a comprehensive example of a modern full-stack application using a decoupled frontend and backend architecture.

‚ú® Features
User Authentication: Secure user registration and login using username and password.

Create & View Posts: Logged-in users can create new posts with a title and content. All posts are displayed on a central community feed.

Clapping: Users can "clap" for posts multiple times to show appreciation, both on the main feed and on the single post page.

Commenting: Users can view and add comments on a dedicated page for each post.

Delete Content: Users have full control to delete their own posts and comments.
